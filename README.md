## **Introduction:**
This project Leverages Databricks and PySpark to build scalable data pipelines for analyzing flight operations, airport performance, passenger behavior, and booking trends. 
The project demonstrates efficient ETL pipelines, transformations, and analytical queries. 
It highlights the power of Spark for handling complex transformation, ingestion and loading data.

## **Data Set:**
We have the attached dataset related to Flights, Airports, Passengers and bookings.
We have one initial file for all the above data and one incremental data as well to test the autoloader.
